REPL

- My explaination -
An REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop), is a program that expects user input,
processes that user input, prints out the results, then loop back into the
input listener. I'd say it's basically a terminal. Examples might be NodeJS'
bash, Python's Shell, Linux Bash.

- Digital ocean -
A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment 
where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then 
the results are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive
 environment to explore tools available in specific environments or 
programming languages. Some examples include the Node.js console, 
IPython, the Bash shell, and the developer console found 
in most web browsers.
