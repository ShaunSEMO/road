Iteration 1 Server-side Rendering - Render front end generated by controllers for the browser

Iteration 2 Client-side Rendering - Writing the front end manually and fetching data from the back end through js. Serving the data as a JSON for
					the JS

Iteration 3 Distributed components - Focus more on design of server code. Creating a persistence system and leaning some OO design patterns as well
					maintaining good separation of concerns
